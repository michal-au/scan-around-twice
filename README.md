# a SCAN benchmark extension

This is a single task meant as an extension of the [SCAN benchmark](https://github.com/brendenlake/SCAN).

Here, the combination of *around* and *twice* is held out from the training. Since these input words have no direct translation counterparts in the output sequences, we argue this task ~~tests for *deeper* aspects of compositionality~~ is more difficult. 

This task was proposed in Auersperger, M. and Pecina, P. (2021). Solving SCAN tasks with data augmentation and input embeddings. Proceedings of RANLP 2021.
